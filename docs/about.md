# About

Welcome to WISER (Weak and Indirect Supervision for Entity Recognition), a system for training sequence tagging models, particularly neural networks for named entity recognition (NER) and related tasks. WISER uses weak supervision in the form of rules to train these models, as opposed to hand-labeled training data.

Please cite the following paper if you are using our tool. Thank you!
